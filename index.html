    <p>Here at HallJohn's we appreciate you being here with us. And to celebrate that we've created a valentine card to show how much you mean to us</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You help this buisness turn into a family</li>
        <li>You help this buisness stay running and continue to make memories</li>  <!--with Money!-->
        <li>And finally you <b><i>DONT</i></b> shop at that dumb Hallmark's place</li> <!--Man the owner hates Hallmark's, forced me to put this in-->
    </ul>
    <p>We love you with all our heart here at HallJohn's, and to show that we wrote a poem for you.</p> <!--Great a poem now too... didn't I sign up to be a back-end developer??-->
    <p>
        We have the <b>BEST</b> customers in the world <br>
        nice, kind, and full of care<br>
        They shop here like lords<br>
        with deals here, there, and everywhere<br>      <!--Wow this poem sucks... THIS is what the owner wants me to use????-->
    </p>
    <p>And this is where this card ends, thank you so much for shopping with us, we really appreciate it. And remember...<br>
    Cheese is 50% off until the 20th            
    </p>        <!--Even after all this they still have to find a way to plug a deal-->

<!--I should really delete all these comments but at this rate I don't really care anymore... we had a total of 5 customers yesterday-->
